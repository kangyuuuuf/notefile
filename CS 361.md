#### Data types

**Categorical:** discreet, not have the order (the genre of music)

**Ordinal:** ordered, discreet (the level of school)

**Continuous:** continuous data (temperature)

#### Simple Visualization of Data

**General principles:** must not mislead or distort; Aesthetically pleasing; Clear, convincing; Show message

Bar graph & Histogram

####  Summarizing 1-D continuous data

For a data set $\{x\}$ or annotated as $\{x_i\}$, we summarize with:

**Location Parameters:** mean, median, mode

**Scale Parameters:** $std$, $variance = std^2$, interquartile range

##### Mean

$$
mean(\{x_i\}) = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}x_i \\
mean(\{k \cdot x_i\}) = k \cdot mean(\{x_i\}) \\
mean(\{x_i + c\}) = mean(\{x_i\}) +c
$$

The mean **minimizes** the sum of the squared distance from any real value.
$$
arg\min_\mu (\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-\mu)^2) = mean(\{x_i\})
$$

##### Standard Deviation($\sigma$)

$$
std(\{x_i\}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-mean(\{x_i\}))^2} = mean(\{(x_i-mean(\{x_i\}))^2\}) \\
 std(\{k \cdot x_i\})= |k|\cdot std(\{x_i\})\\
 std(\{ x_i + c\})= std(\{x_i\})
$$

At most $\frac{N}{k^2}$ items are $k$ standard deviations away from the mean.

##### Variance($\sigma^2$)

$$
var(\{x_i\}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-mean(\{x_i\}))^2
$$

##### Normalized Data

The mean tells where the data set is and the standard deviation tells how spread out it is. If we are interested only in comparing the shape, we could define:
$$
\hat x_i = \frac{x_i-mean(\{x_i\})}{std(\{x_i\})}
$$
And we say $\{\hat x_i\}$ is in standard coordinates.

##### Median

Same feature as mean
