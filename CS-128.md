## Debug

### GDB

To launch the program using gdb, run the following command:

~~~powershell
gdb [programname]
~~~

Then, it will enter gdb for the program, type c as continue.

```powershell
(gdb) run [arguments]
```

#### To walk through the code

```
break [file:line number]
```

*Example usage*: `break skipList.cpp:40`

- Create a breakpoint at the specified line. This will stop the program’s execution when it is being run. (See `run`). When your program is stopped (by previous use of `break`) in a certain file, `break n` will create a breakpoint at line `n` in that same file.*Example*: `break SkipList::insert`.
- Abbreviation: `b`. *Example usage*: `b skipList.cpp:40`

```
clear [file:line number]
```

Removes a breakpoint designated by `break`.

```
run (arguments)
```

Runs the program, starting from the main function. Abbreviation: `r`.

```
list
```

Shows the next few lines where the program is stopped.

```
layout src
```

- Shows an updating window with your source code and the current line of execution.
- Usually easier than type `list` every line or referring back to your open code

```
next
```

- Continues to the next line executed. This does not enter any functions. (See `step` for this).
- Abbreviation: `n`.

```
step
```

- Continues to the next line executed. Unlike `next`, this will *step* into any proceeding functions
- Abbreviation: `s`.

```
finish
```

- Steps out of a function.
- Abbreviation: `fin`.

```
continue
```

- Continues the execution of the program after it's already started to run. `continue` is usually used after you hit a breakpoint.
- Abbreviation: `c`.

#### To viewing the state of the code

```
info args
```

- Shows the current arguments to the function.
- If you are stopped within a class’s function, the `this` variable will appear.

```
info locals
```

- Shows the local variables in the current function.

```
print [variable]
```

- Prints the value of a variable or expression. *Example*: `print foo(5)`
- The functionality of `print` is usually superseded by `info locals` if you are looking to print local variables. But if you want to view object member variables, `print` is the way to go.
- *Example*: `print list->head`. Or `print *integer_ptr`.
- Abbreviation: `p`.

```
display [variable]
```

- Display the value of a variable or expression every time you iterate through the code. Unlike `print`, `display` is persistent. *Example*: `display foo(5)`
- *Example*: `display list->head`. Or `display *integer_ptr`.

#### Narrowing Conversion

A narrowing conversion happens when a variable converts into another type, which cannot state an even approximation of all values.   If the value is out of the scope of the new type, the new value will be meaningless. For example, double to floating is a narrowing conversion. Therefore, this conversion is unsafe.

#### Widening Conversion

A widening conversion happens when a variable converts into another type, including at least approximations of all values.  This means that the new variable will lose some precision since the new type cannot include all the values in the old type. For example, int to double is a widening conversion. During the process, the number after the decimal point will be eliminated. It is safe since the value is in the scope of the new type.

#### Implicit type conversion

Implicit type conversion happens when we write mixed-mode expressions. At this time, the system will change the narrower variable to widen type. This process is called coercion. For example,

~~~c++
5.0 + 10;	// will be double, 15.0
~~~

However, when it comes to defining a variable, it will change into the variable type with no exception. For example,

```c++
int i = 9.0/5.0;	//will be int, 1
double b;
b= 9/5;				//will be double, 1.0
```

#### Explicit type conversion

We can change the type manually. The code is

```c++
static_cast<type>(value);
static_cast<double>(5);		// will be come 5.0
```

#### Preporessor 

#### Compiler

Here is an example to compile the main.cc

```cmake
clang++-10 -std=c++20 main.cc -S -o main.s
```

Where -S means it will stop after compiling. The output of the compiler is assembly code.

#### Assembler

````cmake
clang++-10 -std=c++20 main.cc -c -o main.o
````

The output of the compiler is object code.

#### Linker

When we use the linker command to make an executable doc, we need to link all the source file

```cmake
clang++-10 -std=c++20 main.cc utilities.cc -o main
```

The output of the compiler is executable.
