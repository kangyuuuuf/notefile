# CS 374

This course introduces three distinct fields of computer science research: **computational complexity**, **algorithms**, and **limits of computation**.

#### Definition

1. An algorithm is a step-by-step way to solve a problem. 

2. A problem is some questions that we’d like answered given some input. It should be a decision problem of the form ”Does a given input fulfill property X.” 
3. A Language is a set of strings. Given an alphabet, Σ a language is a subset of Σ$^*$. A language is a formal realization of this problem. 

#### Strings

An alphabet is a **finite** set of symbols.

A string over $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of symbols over $\Sigma$. For integer $n \geq 0, \Sigma^n$ is set of all strings over $\Sigma$ of length $n$. $\Sigma^*$ is set of all strings over $\Sigma$.

##### Emptiness

$\epsilon$ is a string containing no symbols. It is not a set.  $\empty$ is a string of a empty set. Differ than, {$\epsilon$} or {$\empty$}

##### Concatenation and properties

We denote $xy$ or $x \cdot y$, **Concatenation** is defined recursively:

- $xy=y$ if $x = \epsilon$
- $xy = a(wy)$ if $x = aw$

Concatenation is associative: $(uv)w = u(vw)$, hence write $uvw \equiv(uv)w = u(vw)$

**Not** commutative: $uv$ not necessarily equal to $vu$.

The identity element is the empty string $\epsilon$:
$$
\epsilon u = u \epsilon  = u.
$$

#### Substrings, prefixes, Suffixes

$v$ is substring of $w$ $\iff$ there exist strings $x,y$ such that $w= xvy$.

- If $x = \epsilon$ then $v$ is a prefix of $w$
- If $y = \epsilon$ then $v$ is a suffix of $w$

If $w$ is a string, then $w$ n is defined inductively as follows:

- $w^n = \epsilon$ if $n =0$
- $w^n = ww^{n-1}$ if $n > 0$

#### Subsequence

A subsequence of a string w[1...n] is either a subsequence of w[2...n] or w[1] followed by a subsequence of w[2...n].

#### Language

  A language L is a set of strings over Σ. In other words L ⊆ Σ$^*$. In other words L ⊆ Σ$^*$. Standard set operations apply to languages.

Given two sets X and Y of strings (over some common alphabet Σ) the concatenation of X and Y is
$$
XY =\{xy \mid x \in X, y\in Y\}
$$
Note that $\Sigma^+=\cup_{n\ge1}\Sigma^n$.

 

#### Inductive proofs on Strings

The reverse $w^R$ of a string $w$ is defined as follows:

- $w^R = \epsilon$ if $w = \epsilon$
- $w^R = x^Ra$ if $w = ax$ for some $a \in \Sigma$ and string $x$
