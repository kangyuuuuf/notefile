#### Data Mining: On what kinds of data?

-   Database-iruebted data sets and applications
    -   Relational database, data warehouse, transactional database
    -   Object-relational databases, Heterogeneous databases, and legacy databases
-   Advanced data sets and advanced applications
    -   Data steans abd sebsir data
    -   Tune-series data, tenoiral data, sequence data
    -   Structure data, graphs, social networks, and information networks
    -   Spatial data and spatiotemporal data
    -   Multimedia database
    -   Text databases
    -   The World-Wide Web

### Data, Measyrenebts, and Data Preprocessing

#### Recorded Data

-   Relational Records
    -   Relational tables, highly structured 
-   Data natrix, e.g., numerical matrix, crosstabs
-   Transaction Data
-   Document data: Term-frequency vector (matrix) of text documents

#### Graph and Networks

-   Transportation network
-   World Wide Web
-   Molecular Structures
-   Social or information networks

#### Ordered Data

-   Video Data: sequence of images
-   Temporal data: time-series
-   Sequential Data: transaction sequences
-   Genetic sequence data

#### Spatial, image and multimedia Data

-   Spatial data
-   Image data
-   Video data

#### Data Object

Data sets are made up of data objects, and a data object represents an entity

#### Attributes

It has many types: 

-   Nominal: categories, states, or “names of things”
    -   Color
    -   marital status, iccupation, ID numbers, zip codes
-   Binary
    -   Nominal attri bute with only 2 states
    -   Symmetric binary: outcomes are equally important/Asymmetric Binary: outcomes not equally important
-   Ordinal, 
-   Numeric: quantitative
    -   Interval-scaled: Measure on a scale of equal-sized unit, valyues have order, no true zero-point: e.g 100 $^oC$
    -   Ratio-scaled: Inherent zero-point, we can speak of values as being an order of magnitude larger than the unit of measurement, 100 $^oK$

#### Basic Statistical Description of Data

**Motivation**: it is to better understand the data: central tendency, variation and spread

**Data dispersion characteristics**: median, max, min, quantiles, outliers, cariance
$$
median = L_1 + (\frac{n/2-(\sum freq)_l}{freq_{median}} )width
$$

#### Histogram Analysis

Difference between histograms and bar charts

-   Histograms are used to show distributions of variables while bar charts are used to compare variables\
-   Histograms plot binned quantitative data which bar charts plot categorical data
-    Bars can be reordered in bar charts but not in histograms

#### Quantile Plot

For a data $x_i$ sorted in increasing order, $f_i$ indicates that approximately 100 $f_i \%$ if the data are below or equal to the value $x_i$.

#### Cosine Similarity of Two Vectors

Cosine measure: if $d_1$ and $d_2$ are two vectors, then
$$
\cos(d_1,d_2) = \frac{d_1 \cdot d_2}{||d_1|| \times ||d_2||}
$$
We can calculate the similarity by finding the $\theta$ between two vectors. When the $\theta$ is small, it means two vectors are in about the same direction, meaning they are more similar.

#### Correlation Analysis

$x^2$ test: (where $O_i$ is observed and $E_i$ is expected)
$$
\chi^2 = \sum^n_i \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$


Null hypothesis: the two distributions are independent.

The lager $\chi^2$, the higher chance the variable are related. Note: correlation does not imply causality. 

#### Variance for Single Variable

The variance of a random variable $X$ provides a measure of how much the value of $X$ deviates from the mean of the expected value of $X$.
$$
\sigma^2 = var(X) = E[(x-\mu)^2] = \{\begin{matrix} 
\sum_x (x-\mu)^2 f(x) \qquad \text{if $X$ is discrete}\\
\int_{-\infin}^\infin (x-\mu)^2 f(x)dx \qquad \text{if $X$ is continuous}
\end{matrix}
$$
Covariance between two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$
$$
\sigma_{12} = E[(X_1-\mu_1)(X_2-\mu_2)] = E[X_1X_2] - \mu_1\mu_2 = E[X_1X_2]-E[X_1]E[X_2]
$$
Sample covariance between $X_1$ and $X_2$: 
$$
\hat \sigma_{12} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i1}-\hat \mu_1)(x_{i2}-\hat \mu_2)
$$
WIt is a generalization of the sample variance:
$$
\hat \sigma_{11} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i1}-\hat \mu_1)(x_{i1}-\hat \mu_1)
$$
Covariance can be negative!

#### Correlation

Correlation between two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ is the standard covariance obtained by normalizing the covariance with the standard deviation of each variable
$$
\rho_{12} = \frac{\sigma_{12}}{\sigma_1\sigma_2}
$$


Correlation > 0 means positively correlated 

Correlation = 0 means  uncorrelated 

Correlation < 0 means negatively correlated 

#### Covariance Matrix

$$
\Sigma = E[(X- \mu)(X-\mu)^T]
$$

#### KL Divergence: Comparing Two Probability Distribution

$$
D_{KL} (p(x)||q(x)) = \sum _{x\in X} p(x)\ln\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
$$

$$
D_{KL} (p(x)||q(x)) = \int _{-\infin}^\infin p(x)\ln\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}dx
$$
