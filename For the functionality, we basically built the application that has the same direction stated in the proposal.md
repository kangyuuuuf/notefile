For the functionality, we basically built the application that has the same direction stated in the proposal. However, we made two changes. Firstly, we decided to design a website in which the system would check the time conflict for each course that students enrolled in. However, we dropped this functionality due to the random-generated data: we randomly create data such that each student will have 4-5 courses enrolled without checking conflict. Secondly, for the staff accounts, we were planning to change students’ registration. We deleted that functionality since the staff in our project are professors, and professors should have the ability to browse the students ‘ condition but do not have the ability to change it.



The initial idea of creating UCR is that we want students to have one website where they could enroll in classes and check the courses, compared to two UIUC student websites: Self-Service and Course Explorer. In our project, we had already achieved that: students could browse and search the courses and enroll in the class at UCR. Also, we have more search conditions for our users: the search bars depend on GPA and depend on time. However, to create a website that is better than UIUC's official website, there are some functionalities that we are still missing, such as visualization of the student calendar.
