# Mentor Meeting Report

The meeting was held at 3 pm CST yesterday, 21st November. And it is the only mentor meeting that Hector attended. Before that, he kept claiming he was busy with work.

At the beginning of the meeting, Su and I were focused on the code of the project. Hector was a few minutes late entering the meeting. As soon as he entered the meeting, he started to make excuses for his absence, saying that he needed to work late and pay bills. Su said she fully understood the situation and told us she’s been busy too. All she wants is to have the responses on the discord server, even a notification that Hector cannot attend the meeting. 

And Hector started blaming us. He said that he made the project proposal (indeed, he made the first draft of the proposal), but he said that he didn’t get any response from the team. So, then, he could not move forward to the next step. However, I responded to him on the discord server and modified the proposal the same day after he asked.  Honesty, I do not care what he said. I believe that he would find my modification if he opened the proposal doc one more time. But he didn‘t.

**Then, he accused my mentor of not doing her best to arrange the meeting???????** 

Su was actively helping us coordinate the time since the beginning of the project, finding a time that could work for everyone.    She never gave up on anyone, even if some team members never made it to the meeting. As soon as she confirmed with Hector and Pracheta that they would continue the program, she assigned the task to make sure that they could keep up the progress.

Even though I was the only one attending the meeting, Su still dutifully sent the meeting information to the server, so that someone can join the meeting if they have time.<img src="/Users/kangyufeng/Library/Application%20Support/typora-user-images/image-20221122130434818.png" alt="image-20221122130434818" style="zoom:50%;" />

Su spent more than 3 hours a week having 2 meeting weekly, which I believed is far exceeded the time required by the program. **Why does Hector think this is this irresponsible????**

At the end, Su said to Hector,“ that’s why we are here (in this meeting), so that we can help you”

Hector replied, “there is nothing you can help, nothing.” And he left the zoom meeting, which i think it’s very rude.

Then, we were silent for a while, not sure what to do next. I am not able to describe the details but Su felt wronged. She even started to think about not joining the program in the future. From my perspective, I think Hector owes Su an apology.



At last, I heard that Hector had the will to leave the program but he was persuaded by Student leader to continue to complete the project. If the situation is true, I think it is unnecessary because I believe the Apply AI program should respect student’s wishes instead of regarding the completion of program as the goal.
